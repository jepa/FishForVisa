Regulatory boundaries and species distributions are often not aligned, especially in the case of marine species crossing multiple Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). This represents a challenge for fisheries management as policies tend to focus at the national level, yet collaborations are needed to maximize long-term ecological, social and economic benefits. Here, we combined species distributions and the spatial delimitation of EEZs to identify the number of commercially exploited marine species that are shared between neighboring nations. We found that 67% of the world's identified fished species are transboundary (n = 633) and were responsible for 80% of the global-EEZs catches (48 million tons) and 78.5% of fisheries revenue (USD 65 billion) in the last decade. Some countries received over 90% of their catch and economic benefits from a few shared resources. Our analysis suggests that fisheries targeting transboundary species appear worse off than those mainly catching non-transboundary species. Our study has direct implications for the management of transboundary species, pointing to the urgent need for strengthened international cooperation in the management of these fisheries.

# Introduction

Distributions of marine species around the world are not constrained by human-made boundaries; rather they are shaped by biotic and abiotic factors defined by their evolutionary history [@Hutchinson:1957nt; @Nelson:2016kk]. Thus, a species can have a broader distribution (cosmopolitan) or be endemic [@Nelson:2016kk]. However, fisheries management is predicated on the definition of “stocks” that, in most cases, are delineated by human-made spatial boundaries that often do not correspond to biologically-meaningful population units [@Song:2017iua; @FredstonHermann:2018kp]. The delineation of Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) in the early 80s, for instance, established political boundaries across the distribution of many species, creating shared species between nations. Theories and empirical experience have shown that fisheries targeting resources that straddle between political boundaries complicate fisheries management and potentially reduce its effectiveness to achieve stated objectives [@Munro:2002uf]. For instance, climate-driven changes in species distributions have led to conflict between nations due to changes in the proportion of captures [@Munro:2002uf], quota allocation, and fishery newcomers [@Spijkers:2017ij]. Moreover, climate change is likely to exacerbate these types of conflict and presents new challenges for political relations between neighboring countries [@Pinsky:2018cb] and for fisheries management [@Miller:2013iv].

Forty years after the formal adoption of UNCLOS, accurate estimates of the number of exploited marine species that are shared by neighboring nations (hereafter called transboundary species [@Munro:2002uf]) is still unclear. Early data limitations on species' distributions allowed only for an informed guess on the number of transboundary species [@Caddy:1997ue] while a more recent study explored the historical contribution of shared stocks following a literature review [@Teh:2015gd]. Thus, no method has included the actual distribution of species in the quantification of transboundary stocks. Here, we aimed to estimate the number of exploited marine species shared by neighboring countries and determine their contribution to global and regional catch and fisheries revenue. Moreover, we categorize species according to their exploitation rate while identifying differences by habitat preference. We hypothesize that the methodological constraints of previous work has resulted in an underestimation of the contribution of these species to global catch and revenue, and that the proportion of transboundary species is larger than previously estimated.

We overlaid the known distribution of 938 commercially valuable marine species responsible for an average of 96.5% of global EEZ catch reconstructed by the *Sea Around Us* at the species level between 2005 and 2014, and 241 EEZs of 198 coastal territories. We define a ‘stock’ unit as a species in an EEZ, instead of using a population ecology definition (genetically or morphological distinct units) due to lack of such biological information for almost all the species included in this study [@Teh:2015gd]. While we acknowledge that a species could have multiple stocks within an EEZ, many fisheries within a country or EEZ are managed at the species instead of stock level. Also, recent research has suggested strong connectivity between stocks, even when separated by thousands of kilometers [@Ramesh:2019va] providing additional ecological ground for our analysis. For this analysis we only considered shared species between neighboring EEZs, rather than the species’ extended distribution (e.g. we did not include the high seas). We rely on multiple data sources including occurrence, distribution models and catch data and only considered a species to be present in a grid cell if all data sources predicted positive occurrence (see Methods).

# Results and Discussion

We identified 633 transboundary exploited species in the world, more than double the previous estimates [@Teh:2015gd], representing 67.5% of the species analyzed. Between 2005 and 2014, national fleets targeting transboundary species within EEZs cached an average of 47.6 million tons, representing 79.9% of the EEZ-derived catches reconstructed by the *Sea Around us* at the species level, and generating USD 65,483 million in fishing revenue. This is equivalent to 78.5% of the global fishing revenue of the same period. These values are more than the 34.2 million tons and USD 30,700 million in fishing revenue from shared stocks previously estimated [@Teh:2015gd]. Based on our assessment (see Methods), 590 transboundary species were also identified as "discrete" species, meaning that the same species could be shared by two neighboring EEZs (transboundary) but not with a third neighbor (discrete). For example, Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) is fished by Peru, Chile, and Ecuador but only transboundary between Peru and Chile, and thus discrete for Ecuador. The contribution of discrete species was 14.8 million tons representing USD 22,167 million in fishing revenue. Within these species, 305 were considered exclusively discrete, that is, they could be fished by neighboring nations but were not considered transboundary. These species represented only 2.8 million tons and 3,691 million USD between 2005 and 2014. These results underscore the importance of transboundary species at the global level (Fig. 1).

We group countries according to the United Nations sub-regions and found that transboundary species are particularly economically important for Northern America (mean revenue = 3,901 $\pm$ 4,497 million USD) and Eastern Asia (2,827 $\pm$ 2,667 million USD). The estimated revenues from transboundary species in these two regions are significantly different from other regions in terms of revenue (one-way ANOVA; *DF*(16,158) = 4.948, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05) (Fig. 1B). China (USD 6,279 million) in E. Asia and the USA (USD 9,605 million) contribute 55% and 82% to the total revenues from the E. Asia and N. America regions, respectively. In addition to China and the USA, Russia (USD 6,361 million), Peru (USD 5,211) and Japan (USD 3,368) are amongst the top five countries with the most fishing revenue generated from transboundary species in the last decade. These five nations are responsible for 40% of the global fisheries revenue from transboundary species. 

Peru and Russia, responsible for the two largest fisheries in the world [@FAO:2018KK], lead transboundary catch statistics harvesting over 5.8 million tons annually each on average between 2005 and 2014 (Fig. S1). Peru's catches are mainly composed of Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), shared with Chile, and account for 79% of the transboundary species production. Recently these two countries have signed an agreement to work towards standardized stock assessments through coordinated management of this species [@UNDP:2016wp]. Similarly, Russia shares the Alaskan pollock (*Theragra chalcogramma*) fishery with both Japan and the USA celebrating a management agreement with the latter over the Berring Sea since 1988 [@NOAA:gX6CtUTk]. Transboundary species also contribute largely to fisheries in E. Asia (one-way ANOVA; *Df*(16,158) = 2.265, *p* = 0.005, $\alpha$ = 0.05). Particularly, China the world's top fish producer [@FAO:2018KK] getting one third (5.1 million tons) of the total catches from transboundary species, followed by Japan (1.8 million tons) and South Korea (1.06 million tons). Differences in transboundary fisheries can also be illustrated in terms of catch-revenue/EEZ $km^2$ (Fig. 2). As an example, the aggregated area of all EEZs of Northern Europe is 3.3 million $Km^2$, the $5^{th}$ smallest of the 17 groups analyzed (Table S1), however, it has the most revenue (USD 246.7 million per $Km^2$) and catch (260.1 tons per $Km^2$) of transboundary species per EEZ area, but only significantly differing from Sub-Saharan African and Southern Europe countries (*p* < 0.05).

We determined the exploitation category of each species according to the catch trend within each EEZ (Fig. 3). Previous studies demonstrated that catch trends can be used to infer whether a stock is healthy, over-exploited or collapsed [@Kleisner:2011wn]. Following this concept, Category A would represent fisheries that are re-building or under-exploited, category B would be species that are sustainably harvested, and Category C would be species that are over-exploited. We found significant differences in exploitation categories based on whether or not a species was transboundary (MANOVA, *Df*(2,447) = 27.091, *p* < 0.001). Specifically, transboundary species that are only fished by one country are generally less likely to be over-exploited compared to those shared by neighboring countries (Table S2). Significant differences were found for all categories within transboundary species (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(2,447) = 55.01, *p* $\leq$ 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test *p* < 0.05) but only Category C for discrete species (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(2,380) = 21.86, *p* < 0.001; $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test for Categories C-A and C-B *p* < 0.001, and B-A 0.052). This result suggests that the management of discrete species could be better off as the variation between Categories A and B is closer (*p* = 0.052) than for transboundary species (*p* = 0.001).

Empirical analysis suggests that in most cases, management of transboundary species will have better outcomes in terms of fish yields when nations cooperate [@Munro:2002uf]. Examples of successful cooperative-management include Norway and Russia over Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) [@Eide:2013dha] and Namibia and South Africa over hake (*Merluccius spp*) [@Sumaila:2003vw]. Lack of collaboration over shared stocks may threaten stock sustainability, reduce the future profitability potential of the fishery, and create conflict between neighboring nations [@Clark:1980js; @Spijkers:2017ij]. Yet, we acknowledge that cooperation or lack thereof can be a complex process [@Jensen:2015cf], and that there are specific cases where cooperation might not be the best strategy [@Munro:2015df]. 
<!-- Europe has the higest rate of transboundary species per $km^2$ (Figure 2) which is consistent with their Common Fisheries Policy to manage the EEZ as a whole. However, despite some cases of successfull fisheries management, excessive quotas, poorly implemented fishing subsidies, and policy-related issues have failed to control fishing effort threating the sustainabillity of most european stocks [@Khalilian:2010bk].  -->

Transboundary fisheries are abundant and of economic importance for some of the top countries with past fisheries-related conflicts including Canada, the USA, Russia and the European Union (EU) [@Spijkers:2019cz]. For example, since 2007, the EU, Norway, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands have been at odds over the size and relative allocation of total allowable catches for Atlantic mackerel (*Scomber scombrus*) due to a climate-driven distribution shift [@Spijkers:2017ij]. Mackerel is a transboundary species that contributed an average of 598.4 thousand tons to catches (8.19% of total) and USD 850.2 million in revenue (7.17% of total) to the countries involved in the dispute between 2005 and 2014. The relatively small contribution of mackerel to the involved countries suggests that even a small fraction of the year's catch can lead to important conflicts between neighboring countries. Climate change is expected to continue changing the distribution and share proportion of fish stocks among countries up to a degree that new transboundary species will emerge [@Pinsky:2018cb], while some species will exit EEZs [@Oremus:2020id]. Exploring the detailed impacts of climate change in share species is key to develop local adaptation methods to minimize the effect of such distributional change on the conservation of species as well as the economy and food security of coastal nations.

Over 130 marine fish species occur in tropical and subtropical waters around the world [@Nelson:2016kk], from highly migratory species associated to pelagic-oceanic ecosystems like tunas (*Thunnus sp.*), to less mobile reef-associated species like greater amberjack (*Seriola dumerili*), to species found in demersal ecosystems like gilthead seabream (*Sparus aurata*). Species associated to pelagic-oceanic ecosystems are the only group whose EEZ range (i.e., the number of EEZs where the species occur as transboundary) was significantly different from other groups (one-way ANOVA; *DF*(5,597) = 53.82, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test *p* < 0.05) with a median of 40 EEZs per species. The median for species of all other ecosystem preferences is close to, or less than, 20, as many of these species have a narrower distribution or are less mobile (Fig. 4).

B) Catchs of main fishing countries fishing each ecosystem preference's top five species in terms of shared EEZs (shown in bold in A) between 2005 and 2014.](~/GitHub/FishForVisa/Figures/Fig4.png)

Due to their large migration patterns and presence in areas beyond national jurisdiction, many highly migratory species are managed by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Fifteen major RFMOs in the world oversee the management of 99 species [@CullisSuzuki:2010fi]. We estimated that 81.8% of these species are shared across neighboring RFMOs, with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) sharing over 40 species with neighboring RFMOs (Fig. 5). The effectiveness of RFMOs has been previously questioned [@CullisSuzuki:2010fi]. However, despite a global expansion of the industrial fleet in the last decade [@Coulter:2020gr], a recent analysis of 40 tuna and billfish stocks suggests that most stocks are sustainable harvested with only three currently considered as overfished [@Pons:2016ep].

![Figure 5. Number of shared species across RFMOs. Analysis included 99 species managed by Fourteen RFMOs according to Cullis-Suzuk and Pauly, 2010.](~/GitHub/FishForVisa/Figures/Fig5.png)

On the other hand, species with narrower ranges are often managed at the national level due to localized populations [@Payne:2008vm]. However, the potential boundary-crossing of these species must not be ignored. The world of fisheries is highly connected through larvae dispersal and so, even centralized populations could be supplying populations thousands of kilometers away [@Ramesh:2019va]. In addition, coral regions often share multiple species, making coordination among countries key to achieve fisheries and conservation goals [@Payne:2008vm]. Many coastal communities, particularly in developing regions, are highly dependent on subsistence fishing for food security and livelihoods [@CisnerosMontemayor:2016gq; @Wabnitz:2018gf]. For example, all of the top five countries fishing transboundary reef and pelagic-oceanic associated species (Fig. 3B) are among the highest fish consumption countries [@FAO:2018KK]. In these countries, both pelagic and reef fishes contribute substantially to both local food security and livelihood [@Cabral:2018hc]. In the case of Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, they are parties to the Pacific Nauru Agreement that sustainable manage 30% of global skipjack tuna [@Aqorau:2018bh], estimated to produce $2 billion worth of fish every year, representing a role model for transboundary fisheries management [@Hanich:2010ht].

# Conclusions

Our study identified species currently shared by neighboring coastal nations and highlights the importance of these species' contribution to global capture and revenue from wild fisheries. Our results show that captures and revenues from shared species are substantially higher than those from discrete species, as well as than previously estimated. This result highlights the importance of transboundary fisheries and their potential contribution to food security and wellbeing. Moreover, we show significant differences in the management of transboundary and discrete species, suggesting a need for improving the management of transboundary fisheries. Previous work has found that collaboration will result in better outcomes for shared marine resources [@Munro:2002uf]. Thus, countries should pay specific attention in the management of the identified transboundary stocks potentially creating collaborative management plans. Identifying existing transboundary species is the first step towards joint management frameworks that are precautionary, strive for sustainability, and can be flexible to accommodate the uncertain future driven by climate change.

# Materials and Methods

## Databases of species' geographic distribution

To determine the number of transboundary marine species exploited by fisheries within each of the world's EEZs we used the reconstructed list of commercial marine fish and invertebrate species from the *Sea Around Us* (SAU) database (http://www.seaaroundus.org) and determined their current distributions based on an average from 1970-2000. The total number of species analyzed was 938 representing 54% of the average catch reported by the *Sea Around Us* between 2005 and 2014, including generalized categories such as *Marine fish not identified* or *Mollusca*. However, because we carried the analysis at the species level, we did not include such generalized categories in our comparisons. Our final sample represents 63.2% of identified species, accounting for 96.52% of the catch identified at the species' level. To determine the current distribution of exploitable marine species, we used four data sources of species-distributions: (*i*) occurrence data, (*ii*) an Ensemble Environmental Niche Model (ENMs), (*iii*) a life-history-based distribution model, and (*iv*) fisheries catch data (Table 1). Each source represents a different method of estimating the distribution of a given species and thus, provides a more robust result. Only commercial fished species with data from all four sources were included in the analysis.

### *Occurrence data*

Occurrence data was collected from five publicly available repositories: FishBase (http://fishbase.org), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; https://www.gbif.org/), the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; https://obis.org/),  the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC; http://ioc-unesco.org), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; https://www.iucn.org/technical-documents/spatial-data) [@Reygondeau:2019uh].

### *Distribution models*

In addition to occurrence data, we used two different methods to estimate species distributions, hereafter referred to as Ecological Niche Model-Nereus (ENM-Nereus) and Species Distribution Model-SAU (SDM-SAU). Although they use the same occurrence and environmental data, the models are structurally different complementing each other and providing robustness to the results.

The ENM-Nereus consists in a multimodel approach based on a Bioclim and a Boosted Regression Tree model [@Thuiller:2009gp], a Maxent model [@Phillips:2006ff], and a Non-Parametric Probabilistic Ecological Niche Model [@Beaugrand:2011fd]. Environmental variables utilized in the models include sea surface temperature, surface pH, surface oxygen concentration, and vertically integrated (0–100 m) net primary production (NPP) [@Asch:2018ca]. The ENM-Nereus employed all of the observational data-sources previously mentioned. Global environmental conditions were average for the period 1970-2000 and averaged for three Earth System Models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL- https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/earth-system-model/), the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL- www.icmc.ipsl.fr/), and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI- www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/). See [@Asch:2018ca; @Reygondeau:2019uh] for model details.

The SDM-SAU model follows a five-steps process based on species-specific life history data, rather than environmental variables [@Close:2006ux; @Pauly:2016uz]. For each commercial marine species, the model first uses the FAO major fishing areas and countries' EEZs to determine a broad distribution. It then uses life history information to delimit its range within the FAO fishing area (e.g., thermal preference, depth limit). The range is delimited even further by expert-review polygons and compared with that of AquaMaps [@Kaschner:2016tl], OBIS and GBIF occurrence data. The model then determines a species habitat preference based on the assumption that the relative abundance of a species is determined by the number of habitats in a grid cell and the distance of the species to each habitat, as well as the importance of the habitat to the species size. Finally, the species equatorial submergence (e.g. the latitudinal region where a species is not seen in between poles) is estimated for each species. See [@Close:2006ux; @Pauly:2016uz] for model details.

### *Catch data*

The previous models combine observational data with a series of biotic and abiotic data to determine the probability that a species will be found in a given space at a given time. However, this does not mean that the species in question will actually be there. While the models do use approaches to double-check species occurrences (e.g., ENM-Nereus uses four different species distribution algorithms and SPD-SAU undertakes validation by means of other models), we used a fourth data source to corroborate the models’ outputs. The Sea Around Us estimates total reconstructed catches - catches based on all publicly available information sources and including discards, as well as unreported and illegal catches that are not included in available FAO data - for each country. Catches are also spatially allocated [@Zeller2016]. Thus, we used the Sea Around Us catch reconstruction database from 2005 to 2014 as the fourth dataset to estimate transboundary species and to estimate their catch contribution within EEZs. We selected this time frame to investigate the recent (our time frame includes the last ten years of data) contribution of transboundary fisheries to catches and revenue from fisheries and to reduce the uncertainty embedded in the reconstruction process (See key uncertainties, below).

## Determining transboundary species trait

We developed a four-criteria methodology to determine whether or not a species can be considered transboundary. Only species that meet all criteria were considered as transboundary and the analysis was undertaken only within the EEZs of coastal states. In some cases, criteria can also be interpreted as indices to measure the uncertainty in the analysis as they provide a continuous index (e.g. from 0 to 1) rather than a discrete, yes or no, index. 

### Criteria 1; Neighboring EEZs

As previously mentioned, we define transboundary species as those marine species that occur within the EEZs of two or more neighboring countries. Hence, according to this criteria a species was only considered as transboundary if it was shared between two neighboring countries, regardless of the species extended distribution. We defined EEZ boundaries using the Sea Around Us shapefile (updated 1 July 2015, available from http://www.seaaroundus.org), noting that it subdivides EEZs by regions (e.g., Mexico Pacific and Mexico Atlantic), and determined the intersections between polygons using the R package sf. When estimating transboundary species, we filtered out those shared by EEZs sub-regions, and when aggregating results by country, species that occurred in more than one sub-region were only accounted for once. Species that were present in EEZs that were non-continental territories neighboring other countries were kept separately (e.g., Argentina and Falkland Islands), but removed in cases where the non-continental territory belonged to the same nation (e.g., Brazil and Fernando de Noronha). Associated states like Puerto Rico and Hong Kong were added to their Sovereign (e.g. Puerto Rico with the United States and Hong Kong with China). 

### Criteria 2; Data agreement

We used the occurrence database, the ENM-Nereus model, and SDM-SAU model to determine the presence of each species within each of the $0.5^{\circ}$ x $0.5^{\circ}$ grid cells. We computed a *Species Index* by dividing the number of datasets that confirmed the presence of a species in a grid cell over the total number of datasets (n = 3). The index is unit-less and represents a scale from 0.3 to 1, with 0.3 indicating that only one dataset reported the presence of the species in a grid cell, 0.6 two out of three sources, and 1 pointing to agreement across all 3 datasets. All analyses only considered cases where *Species Index* = 1 to obtain a more conservative estimate of transboundary species.

### Criteria 3; Modeling verification

We assumed that a species was only present in a given grid-cell if it was reported in the Sea Around Us catch database. Therefore, all species that were not reported as caught in any single year between the reference years (2005 to 2014) in a given grid-cell were dropped, regardless of the *Species Index*. This rule assumes that if a commercial species is projected within any fishing country, such a species would have been fished, and thus reported at some point over a period of time (here 2005 - 2014), thus validating the models. See [@Pauly:2019bf] and [@Zeller2016] for catch reconstruction and spatial allocation details.

### Criteria 4; Spatial distribution

Finally, to have a more robust result and not categorize a species as transboundary based on its presence in a single $0.5^{\circ}$ x $0.5^{\circ}$ grid cell within an EEZ, we computed an *Area Index*. The *Area Index* consist in the proportion of a given species' overarching shared distribution between neighboring EEZs accounted for by each individual EEZ. We classified a species as transboundary if both neighboring EEZs enclosed over 25% of the species joint shared distribution. This threshold can be lowered for a more relaxed result or increased for a more conservative estimate (Fig. S2).

## Fisheries trends

We estimated the economic contribution in 2010 real USD of transboundary species for each country using global ex-vessel price data [@Tai2017]. The database we draw from includes ex-vessel price from multiple sources and a structured interpolation method (e.g. similar countries, species) to fill in data gaps [@Sumaila:2015uc]. The contribution of transboundary species was derived by aggregating the catch of species occurring within the EEZs of countries sharing that species. For this study, we did not include catch nor revenue from areas beyond national jurisdiction. Finally, we used the catch data to determine the exploitation category of each species within an EEZ. Although this method has previously been used to estimate stock status [@Grainger:1996tk], the categories presented here are intended as catch trends, and not fishing status for each species as many environmental and social-economic factors (e.g. temperature, markets, fishing policies) affect fishing effort and catch volume [@Pauly:2013gs; @Branch:2008kk]. We only assessed species within each EEZ for which at least ten years of data were available between the first and last reported catch and with at least five consecutive years of data. Three final categories were drawn for each species depending on the catch volume within each EEZ (e.g. present, maximum and minimum EEZ's historical catch) and the year (e.g. year of maximum historical catch of the species within that EEZ) (Table 2) [@Kleisner:2011wn]. Following this concept, Category A would represent fisheries that are re-building or under-exploited, Category B would be species that are sustainable harvested, and Category C would be species that are over-exploited. Finally, we reported the predominant category over the last ten years of catch data (2005-2014).

## Statistical analysis

All analyses were run using the statistical software *R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20)* with the packages *data.table* [@Packagedatatable:2019uh], *janitor* [@PackagejanitorSim:2018ur], *wesanderson* [@Packagewesanderson:2018vn], *rfishbase* [@PackagerfishbaseR:2019th], *R.matlab* [@PackageRmatlabRe:2018un], *sf* [@PackagesfSimpleF:2018vp], *sp* [@PackagespClasses:2019tn], *tidiverse* [@PackagetidyverseE:2017vq], *tidytext* [@PackagetidytextTe:2019vk], and *zoo* [@PackagezooSInfr:2019tm]. All code is available at https://github.com/jepa/FishForVisa. We performed a series of one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to determine statistically significant differences between the means of different groups (e.g., geographical regions, species, exploitation categories) of transboundary species and their contribution to catch and fishing revenue [@Chambers:1992up; @Krzanowski:1990wm]. We used the standard *R* functions for the ANOVA and MANOVA after testing for assumptions. In cases where the ANOVA assumptions were not clearly meet we ran the non-parametric version Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test to confirm the results [@Hollander:2013wz].

## Key uncertainties
<!-- # Related to Criteria 1 (neighbors) -->
We have identified four key uncertainties in the method that may affect the estimation of transboundary stocks. Firstly, we ran the analysis at the species level due to limited spatial-specific data on species sub populations (stocks), therefore we are not able to identify transboundary stocks within EEZs. While we acknowledge that a species could have multiple stocks within an EEZ, many fisheries within a country or EEZ are managed at the species instead of stock level. Also, recent research has suggested strong connectivity between stocks, even when separated by thousands of kilometers [@Ramesh:2019va] providing additional ecological ground for our analysis. We limited the distribution of a species by defining transboundary only between neighboring countries (e.g. US and Canada) and did not include countries that were separated by another country (e.g. Canada and Mexico) and/or the high seas (e.g. Canada and Spain). Our results are likely a conservative estimation of transboundary species as we did not cover all marine taxa in the world [@Reygondeau:2019uh] and only analyzed species present in all four data sources. Nevertheless, our results are representative of a substantial proportion of the world's marine catches and revenue from economically important marine fisheries.
<!-- Related to Criteria 2 (Models) -->
Secondly, the predicted species distribution is affected by the uncertainties of the environmental data and models used for such predictions. Structural differences within Earth System Models results in variations of oceanic conditions, which undoubtedly affect the ENM-Nereus. We averaged the results from the three models in an effort to capture the structural variation across models. Climate natural variability is a major driver of marine species distribution, potentially removing a species from an EEZ for long periods (e.g. Anchovies and Sardines "regimes" in the Eastern Pacific are strongly influenced by water temperature decal oscillations [@Chavez:2003jr]). Thus, a species’ distribution can potentially be reduced or shifted in such way that it only covers one EEZ until oceanic conditions change again and the associated species' distribution expands. To account for such climate variability, we derived the ENM-Nereus results as an average of oceanic conditions between 1970 and 2000. This is not an issue for the SDM-SAU as it does not directly require environmental variables [@Pauly:2016uz].
<!-- Related to Criteria 3 (SAU catch data) -->
Thirdly, we assumed that, if the Sea Around Us reconstructed data recorded a species as caught in any given grid cell, then the species was present within that grid cell. While catch data is not exempt of uncertainty, in most cases, the differences between the Sea Around Us and the FAO self-reported data is smaller towards recent years [@Pauly:2019bf]. Thus, we limited the catch data reference period in our analyses to between 2005 and 2014, the last ten years of data available. Likewise, the spatial allocation of the catch is subjected to impressions, mainly produced by differences in the spatial scale of the original data and the method employed by the Sea Around Us. However, this discrepancy is mainly applicable to data provided by RFMOs in the high seas, which were not included in this study (see http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/spatial-catch and @Zeller2016 for mode details in the spatial allocation of the SAU).
<!-- Related to Criteria 4; Spatial distribution -->
Finally, the results of this study only considered those species that had a *Species Index* of 1 (e.g. all datasets agree on presence) and at least 25% of *Area Index* (e.g. the species shared distribution was at least 25% in each EEZ). This presents a relative conservative estimate of the number of transboundary species in the world. However, using a different *Species Index* will give results based on less datasets while a smaller *Area Index* will estimate more transboundary species (Fig. S2).

The number of gridcells in which a species is present (*Area Index*) is expected to directly influence whether or not a species is considered transboundary. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity of our results to the *Area Index* by estimating the number of transboundary species along a gradient of values (Fig. S2). As expected, using a more relaxed value (e.g. the species is present within 10% or more of the EEZ) will result in a greater number of transboundary species (median of 40 EEZs shared per species), while a more restrictive value (e.g., 50%) results in a median estimate of 4. The current analysis utilized a 25% *Area Index* threshold (Fig. S2 - darker histogram).

<!-- From 1973 to 1982, members of the United Nations held a series of meetings to discuss regulations regarding the high seas, a region of international common property, at that time, consisting of waters from 12 miles from shore [@McRaeandMunro1989]. The establishment of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allowed coastal states to claim jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources over 200 nautical miles off their coasts [@UN:1982]. While intended to improve fisheries management by granting property rights over shared resources, this arbitrary delimitation of management areas was not informed by bio-geography, essentially ignoring species distributions and creating what we know today as shared fish stocks [@Gulland, @Munro2002]. Fish stocks, are comonly refered in fisheries management as a particular population that is more or less isolated from other stocks of the same species and hence self-sustaining [@FAO:1999tk]. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recognizes three types of shared stocks: (*i*) transboundary stocks, shared by 2 or more neighboring coastal nations; (*ii*) straddling stocks, occurring in two or more adjacent national jurisdictions and the high seas; and (*iii*) highly migratory stocks, found in the EEZs of coastal nations that are not necessarily adjoining, and the high seas. The inception of shared stocks called for the establishment of new fisheries management methods. Managers and scientists adopted a game theory approach – or means to analyze strategic interactions among decision-makers – which demonstrates that collaboration is most likely to result in the best overall outcome for nations sharing a common resource [@Bailey:2010ga,@Eide:2013dh]. Lack of collaboration in shared stocks may threaten stock sustainability [@Clark:1980js; @Nguyen:2018dk], reduce the profitability potential of the fishery [@Merino:2007jz], and lead to conflict between coastal nations [@Spijkers:2017ij], although cooperation and non-cooperation can be more complex [@Jensen:2015cf]. Moreover, under climate change, species distributions will shift [@Cheung2016], resulting in new shared stocks [@Pinsky:2018cb] and highlighting the key role cooperative fisheries management can play in maintaining stocks and profitability [@Nguyen:2018dk] as well as hopefully reducing fisheries conflict [@Spijkers:2019cz]. -->

<!-- There is a gap in assessing the nature and number of transboundary species in the world based on their spatial distribution. Caddy [@Caddy:1997ue] in 1997 estimated that there could be up to 1,500 transboundary fish species in the world. However, such estimation lacked a proper assessment due to limited information on the distribution of species at the time [@Caddy:1997ue]. More recently, Teh et al. [@Teh:2015gd] estimated that 206 species can be considered shared, accounting for a total catch of 34.2 million t and a global landed value of USD 30.7 trillion. While this represents a good starting point, the analysis was based on a literature review of shared species and did not include a mechanistic way of determining the transboundary nature of the species [@Teh:2015gd]. Thus, despite recent research highlighting the interconnection of marine species [@Ramesh:2019va], the total number of transboundary species is yet to be identified at a global scale. Yet, such an understanding is critical to effectively managing fisheries, as needs differ substantially between discreet and shared species [@Mills] and climate change will yield new challenges associated with new shared fisheries [@Pinsky:2018cb]. -->

<!-- *Getting accurate estimates of the number of shared species and where they are located can help develop fisheries management and conservation plans that account for the challenges from transboundary resources management.*  -->

<!-- The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recognizes three types of shared stocks: (i) transboundary stocks, shared by 2 or more neighboring coastal nations; (ii) straddling stocks, occurring in two or more adjacent national jurisdictions and the high seas; and (iii) highly migratory stocks, found in the EEZs of coastal nations that are not necessarily adjoining, and the high seas. We focus on estimating the number of species that meet the first category. -->

<!-- We used four-criteria that combined multiple species distribution data-sources and the world's EEZs to determine if a species can be considered a “shared species”. The first criteria consisted in only considering shared species between neighboring EEZs, rather than the extended distribution. For the second criteria we considered a species to be present in a grid cell if all data sources predicted positive occurrence. Current species distributions were predicted from occurrence records obtained from publicly available observational databases of the world’s marine species and two structurally distinct species distribution models [@Asch:2018ca; Reygondeau:2019uh; @Zeller2016] (see Methods). The third criteria determined whether the species were exploited at the grid cell using spatially explicit catch data [@Zeller2016]. A species was kept if both catch data and predicted species occurrences were positive at the same spatial cells. Finally, the last criteria determined a spatial threshold to confirm that a species occurs in both neighboring EEZs. Once we have identified the shared stocks, we estimated the contribution of the species to fishing revenues and landings using the SAU database [@Zeller2016] and categorized them according to catch trends [@Kleisner:2013gh].  -->
