# Abstract

Regulatory boundaries and species distributions are often not aligned, especially in the case of marine species crossing multiple Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). This represents a challenge for fisheries management as policies tend to focus at the national level, yet collaborations are needed to maximize long-term ecological, social and economic benefits of shared marine species. Here, we combined species distributions and the spatial delineation of EEZs to identify the number of commercially exploited marine species that are shared between neighboring nations. We found that 67% **of the species analyzed** are transboundary (n = 633). Between 2005 and 2014, fisheries targeting these species within the global-EEZs caught in average 48 million tonnes representing an average of USD 77 billion in fishing revenue per year. Some countries received over 90% of their catch and economic benefits from a few shared resources. Our analysis suggests that catches from transboundary species appear **to be declining** more than those from non-transboundary species. Our study has direct implications **for managing** fisheries of transboundary species, highlighting the need for strengthened international cooperation.


# Introduction

Distributions of marine species around the world are not constrained by human-made boundaries; rather they are shaped by biotic and abiotic factors as well as the species' evolutionary history [@Hutchinson:1957nt; @Nelson:2016kk]. A species can be widely distributed (cosmopolitan) or endemic [@Nelson:2016kk]. Fisheries management is predicated on the definition of “stocks” that, in most cases, are delineated by human-made spatial boundaries while such delineation often does not correspond to biologically-meaningful population units [@Song:2017iua; @FredstonHermann:2018kp]. The officialization of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) under Part V of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) in the early 80s, for instance, extended political boundaries **from 12 to 200 nautical miles to give coastal nations property rights over marine resources [@osthagen:2020hd].** However, the boundaries of EEZs cut across the distribution of many species, creating shared stocks between nations [@UnitedNations:1986tl. **Shared stocks can be classified as three non-exclusive categories; "transboundary" - stocks that cross the EEZs of two or more coastal states; "straddling" - stocks that, cross neighboring EEZs and the adjacent high seas; and "highly migratory" - stocks that cross non-neighboring EEZs and the high seas (mainly tunas) [@Munro:2004th]. Here, our study focuses on the "transboundary" and "straddling" species that are exploited by fisheries operating within EEZs.** 

Theories and empirical experience have shown that fisheries targeting resources that straddle between political boundaries complicate fisheries management and potentially reduce its effectiveness to achieve their stated objectives [@Munro:2002uf; @Englander:2019dq]. **For instance,** climate-driven changes in species distributions have led to conflicts between nations that were driven, at least partly, by changes in the proportion of captures [@Munro:2002uf], quota allocation, and fishery newcomers [@Spijkers:2017ij]. Moreover, climate change is likely to exacerbate these types of conflict and presents new challenges for political relations between neighboring countries [@Pinsky:2018cb] and for fisheries management [@Miller:2013iv]. Therefore, having an accurate understanding of the distribution and scale of transboundary and straddling fish stocks and fisheries is important to inform their sustainable management, particularly under climate change. 

Forty years after the formal adoption of UNCLOS **and the subsequent 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement for the cooperation on the management and conservation of straddling resources [@UnitedNations:1995fs], accurate estimates of the number of exploited marine species that are shared by neighboring nations are still unclear. With limited biogeographical data, an informed guess suggested that there were approximately 500 to 1500 exploited transboundary stocks [@Caddy:1997ue]. Literature review undertaken by a more recent study included 344 shared taxa and the historical contributions to fisheries [@Teh:2015gd].** However, these previous studies did not include species' biogeography in the quantification of transboundary stocks. Here, we aim to estimate the number of exploited marine species shared by neighboring countries and determine their contribution to global and regional catch and fisheries revenue. Moreover, we categorize species according to their catch trends while identifying the differences between species by habitat preference. We hypothesize that the methodological constraints of previous studies has resulted in an underestimation of the number of transboundary stocks and their contribution to global catch and revenue.

We overlaid the known distribution of 938 commercially valuable marine species that are responsible for an average of 96.5% of global EEZ catch reconstructed by the *Sea Around Us* at the species level between 2005 and 2014, and 280 EEZs of 198 coastal **countries (See methods**). We define a ‘stock’ unit as a species in an EEZ, instead of using a population ecology definition (genetically or morphological distinct units), due to a lack of such biological information for almost all the species included in this study [@Teh:2015gd]. While we acknowledge that a species could have multiple stocks within an EEZ, many fisheries within a country or EEZ are managed at the species instead of stock level **(or even as groups containing multiple species). For example, shrimps (e.g. Litopenaeus stylirostris or Farfantepenaeus californiensis) in the Pacific coast of Mexico [@DiarioOficialdelaFederacionDOF:2018wt] and hammerhead shark (*Sphyrna zygaena*) in Peru [@MAP:2017uf] include multiple populations that are exploited by each country’s fisheries, but they are managed at the species level in both cases.** Also, recent research has suggested strong connectivity between fish stocks, even when separated by thousands of kilometers [@Ramesh:2019va] through larval dispersal and **adult migration e.g. fishing migrating between reefs in neighboring EEZs [@Levin:2018in]. Such ecological connectivity further highlights to the importance of accounting for transboundary stocks using biogeographical information and making the results relevant from a fisheries management perspective**. For this analysis we only considered shared species between neighboring EEZs, rather than the species’ extended distribution (e.g. we did not include the high seas). We rely on multiple data sources including occurrence, distribution models and catch data and only consider a species to be present in a grid cell if all data sources predicted positive occurrence (see Methods).

# Results and Discussion

**We identified 633 transboundary exploited species in the world (67.5% of the 938 species analyzed), almost double the previous estimates [@Teh:2015gd].** Between 2005 and 2014, national fleets targeting these transboundary species within EEZs **caught** an **annual** average of 48.5 million tonnes, representing 82.3% of the EEZ-derived catches reconstructed by the *Sea Around us* at the species level (Fig. 1A). These catches generated **a yearly average of USD 77,591 million in fishing revenue (78.5% of the global fishing revenue) during the same time period.** These values are more than the previously estimated 34.2 million tonnes in catches and USD 40,187 million (**in 2019 value**) in fishing revenue from shared stocks [@Teh:2015gd].**When we re-estimated the transboundary species’ catches using catch data that are consistent with those used in previous studies (FAO global reported data in year 2006), the 633 transboundary species we identified here accounted for 40.4 million tonnes of catches i.e., 18% higher than previously estimates. Our results suggests that the participation of transboundary species in global catch and fishing revenue might have been previously underestimated due to an incomplete knowledge on the transboundary nature of marine fished species.** The 305 species that are considered non-transboundary (termed as ‘discrete’ species here, see methods - Determining transboundary species trait) contributed a much smaller proportion of catches and revenues compared to those from the 633 transboundary species identified in this study. These discrete species represented only **an annual average of** 2.8 million tonnes and 4,282 million USD between 2005 and 2014. These results underscore the importance of transboundary species at the global level.

In many cases, according to our categorization criteria, a transboundary species can distribute in multiple EEZs but only counted as transboundary in a subset of EEZs (see Methods). For example, the distribution of Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) spans over the EEZs of Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. However, our study only counted the transboundary stocks in Peru and Chile [@Cashion:2018cg]. Anchoveta in Ecuadorian waters only include a small proportion of the shared distribution range **(spatial threshold between Ecuador and Peru < 10%; see methods - Criteria 3)** and thus do not meet our criteria to be considered as transboundary stock. Situation similar to the example of Peruvian anchoveta in Ecuadorian waters is common amongst the transboundary species identified in this study. Overall, 590 of the 633 transboundary species have stocks in EEZs that are excluded from being counted as transboundary because they do not meet all our categorization criteria. The **annual average contribution from all the excluded stocks of transboundary species to fisheries (e.g., Ecuador’s anchoveta catch) between 2005 and 2014** was 10.8 million tonnes, representing USD 19,243 million in fishing revenue **over the same time period.**

We group countries according to the United Nations sub-regions and found that transboundary species are particularly economically important for Northern America (**average country** revenue = 4,680 $\pm$ 6,000 million USD) and Eastern Asia (3,779 $\pm$ 3,093 million USD) (Fig. 1B). The estimated **per country** revenues from transboundary species in these two regions are significantly different from other regions (one-way ANOVA; *DF*(16,165) = 5.081, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05). China (USD 7,284 million) and the USA (USD 11,604 million) contribute 55% and 82% to the **annual average** revenues from 2005 to 2014  in **Eastern** Asia and **Northern America**, respectively. In addition to China and the USA, Russia (USD 7,379 million), Peru (USD 6,044 **million**) and Japan (USD 3,907 **million**) are among the top five countries with the most fishing revenue generated from transboundary species between 2005 and 2014 (Fig. 1A). These five nations were responsible for 41% of the yearly global fisheries revenue from transboundary species.

Peru and Russia, having the two largest fisheries by total catch in the world [@FAO:2018KK], caught on average between 2005 and 2014 over 5.8 million tonnes by each country on average between 2005 and 2014 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Peru's catches are mainly composed of Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), shared with Chile, and account for 79% of the **national** transboundary species production. Recently these two countries have signed an agreement to work towards standardized stock assessments through coordinated management of this species [@UNDP:2016wp]. **Similarly, Russia, Japan and the USA have made a management agreement over Alaskan pollock (*Theragra chalcogramma*) in the Bering Sea since 1988 [@NOAA:gX6CtUTk].** Transboundary species also contribute largely to fisheries in **Eastern** Asia (one-way ANOVA; *Df*(16,158) = 2.265, *p* = 0.005, $\alpha$ = 0.05). Particularly, China the world's top fish producer [@FAO:2018KK] **gets** one third (5.1 million tonnes) of the total catches from transboundary species, followed by Japan (1.8 million tonnes) and South Korea (1.06 million tonnes). Differences in transboundary fisheries can also be illustrated in terms of catch-revenue over the area ($km^2$) of the EEZ (Fig. 2). As an example, the aggregated area of all EEZs of Northern European countries where transboundary species are present is 3.3 million $km^2$, the $6^{th}$ smallest of the 17 groups analyzed (Supplementary Table S1). However, it has the second **highest average** revenue (USD 26.1 thousand per $km^2$) and the **highest average** catch (19.9 tonnes per $km^2$) of transboundary species per EEZ area between 2005 and 2014. Countries from Western Europe get significantly more revenue from transboundary fisheries per $km^2$ than any other country (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(16,165) = 3.267, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test *p* $\leq$ 0.05).

**We determined the catch trend of each species within each EEZ classifying them as increasing (Category A), constant (Category B) or decreasing (Category C) (Fig. 3). While previous studies demonstrated that catch trends can be used to infer whether a stock is healthy, re-building, over-exploited or collapsed [@Kleisner:2011wn], several factors can influence stock status. Therefore, our intention here is to examine where the catch trends of transboundary species are different from non-transboundary species between 2005 and 2010 relative to historic catch since 1951 (See methods). We found significant differences within all catch trend categories for transboundary species (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(2,459) = 47.94, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test *p* $\leq$ 0.001) as opposite to discrete species where no significant differences where registered (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(2,106) = 1.885, *p* = 0.157; $\alpha$ = 0.05). We also found significant differences in catch trends when directly comparing transboundary to discrete species categories (MANOVA, *Df*(2,459) = 19.001, *p* < 0.001). Overall, transboundary species that are only fished by one country are generally less likely to have a decreasing catch trend compared to when the species is shared by neighboring countries (Supplementary Table S2)**.

Empirical analysis suggests that in most cases, management of transboundary species will have better outcomes in terms of fish yields when nations cooperate [@Munro:2002uf]. Examples of successful cooperative-management include Norway and Russia over Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) [@Eide:2013dha] and Namibia and South Africa over hake (*Merluccius spp*) [@Sumaila:2003vw]. Lack of collaboration over shared stocks may threaten stock sustainability, reduce the future profitability potential of the fishery, and create conflict between neighboring nations [@Clark:1980js; @Spijkers:2017ij]. Yet, we acknowledge that cooperation or lack thereof can be a complex process [@Jensen:2015cf], and that there are specific cases where cooperation might not be the best strategy [@Munro:2015df]. 
<!-- Europe has the higest rate of transboundary species per $km^2$ (Figure 2) which is consistent with their Common Fisheries Policy to manage the EEZ as a whole. However, despite some cases of successfull fisheries management, excessive quotas, poorly implemented fishing subsidies, and policy-related issues have failed to control fishing effort threating the sustainabillity of most european stocks [@Khalilian:2010bk].  -->

Transboundary fisheries are abundant and of economic importance for some of the top countries with past fisheries-related conflicts including Canada, the USA, Russia and the European Union (EU) [@Spijkers:2019cz]. For example, since 2007, the EU, Norway, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands have been at odds over the size and relative allocation of total allowable catches for Atlantic mackerel (*Scomber scombrus*) due to a climate-driven distribution shift [@Spijkers:2017ij]. Atlantic Mackerel is a transboundary species that **straddles into the high seas**. Amongst the countries involved in the 2007 Atlantic mackerel fisheries dispute, mackerel contributed an annual average (between 2005 and 2014) of 598.4 thousand tonnes (8.19%) to these countries’ total catches and USD 850.2 million (7.17%) to their total fishing revenue. Climate change is expected to continue changing the distribution and share proportion of fish stocks among countries up to a degree that new transboundary species will emerge [@Pinsky:2018cb], while some species will exit EEZs [@Oremus:2020id]. Exploring the detailed effects of climate change in the distribution of shared species is key to develop local adaptation methods to anticipate negative impacts to sustainability. **. For example, understanding how climate change will modify the proportion of transboundary species that each neighboring EEZ share31, the time-frame at when the changes in sharing will happen, and the economic consequence of such effects can inform the development of more climate-resilient international treaties improving fisheries management [@RashidSumaila:tp]**

Over 130 marine fish species occur in tropical and subtropical waters around the world [@Nelson:2016kk], from highly migratory species associated to pelagic-oceanic ecosystem like tunas (*Thunnus sp.*), to less mobile reef-associated species like greater amberjack (*Seriola dumerili*), to species found in demersal ecosystems like gilthead seabream (*Sparus aurata*). Species associated to pelagic-oceanic ecosystems are the only group whose EEZ range (i.e., the number of EEZs where the species occur as transboundary) was significantly different from other groups (one-way ANOVA; *DF*(5,597) = 53.82, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test *p* < 0.05) with a median of 40 EEZs per species. The median for species of all other ecosystem preferences is close to, or less than, 20, as many of these species have a narrower distribution or are less mobile (Fig. 4A). **This result is likely an effect of the broad distribution that many of the species with preference for pelagic-oceanic ecosystems have. Many pelagic-oceanic species are highly migratory and straddle across one EEZ to another while crossing the high seas. Thus, the number of non-neighboring EEZs sharing a highly migratory species can be over 100, like the case of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) (Fig. 4A). Due to their large migration patterns and presence in areas beyond national jurisdiction, many highly migratory species are managed by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs).**

B) Average catch between 2005 and 2014 of top five fishing countries capturing the top five shared species of each ecosystem preference (shown in bold on a). Note that there could be > 5 species due to similar sharing values. ** The category "Other" consists of species that have no classification according to FishBase.**](../Figures/Fig4.png)

**Many transboundary species are not considered highly migratory but still shared by numerous neighboring EEZs (e.g. Belone belone) (Fig. 4A). In addition, many fish stocks have meta-populations that are connected through larvae dispersal with ‘source’ populations potentially supporting ‘sink’ populations thousands of kilometers away [@Ramesh:2019va]. For example, despite coral reef-related species being among the less shared neighboring EEZs identified in this study (Fig. 4A), coral regions often share multiple species through larval connectivity [@Schill:2015fh] and adult movement [@Levin:2018in]. Species with narrower ranges are often managed at the national level due to localized populations [@Payne:2008vm] but the potential boundary-crossing of these species must not be ignored. In some areas like the Caribbean and the Western Indian Ocean, transboundary marine protected areas have been identified as potential tools for achieving fisheries and conservation goals [@Levin:2018in; @Perez:2019dm]. The proper management of coral reef species is very important for many coastal communities, particularly in developing regions, that are highly dependent on subsistence fishing for food security and livelihoods [@CisnerosMontemayor:2016gq; @Wabnitz:2018gf]. For instance some of the top countries fishing transboundary reef and pelagic-oceanic associated species (Fig. 4B**) are among the highest fish consumption countries [@FAO:2018KK]. In countries like the Philippines both pelagic and reef fishes contribute substantially to both local food security and livelihood [@Cabral:2018hc]. 

# Conclusions

Our study identified species currently shared by neighboring coastal nations and highlights the importance of these species' contribution to global capture and revenue from wild fisheries. Our results show that captures and revenues from shared species are substantially higher than those from discrete species, as well as than previously estimated**[@Teh:2015gd]**. This result highlights the importance of transboundary fisheries and their potential contribution to food security and wellbeing. Moreover, we show significant differences in **the catch trends** of transboundary and discrete species, suggesting a need for improving the management of transboundary fisheries. Previous work has found that collaboration will result in better outcomes for shared marine resources [@Munro:2002uf]. Thus, countries should pay specific attention in the management of the identified transboundary stocks potentially creating collaborative management plans. Identifying existing transboundary species is the first step towards joint management frameworks that are precautionary, strive for sustainability, and can be flexible to accommodate the uncertain future driven by climate change.

# Materials and Methods

## Databases of species' geographic distribution

**The Sea Around Us has reconstructed global fisheries catches from 1950 to 2014 identifying commercial marine fish and invertebrates as well as fishing regions [@Zeller2016]. We used the Sea Around Us reconstructed species list to determine the number of transboundary marine species exploited by fisheries within each of the world's EEZs. The total number of species analyzed was 938 representing 67% of identified species by the Sea Around Us and accounting for 96.52% of the catch identified at the species’ level.** To determine the current distribution of exploitable marine species, we used four data sources of species-distributions: (*i*) occurrence data, (*ii*) an Ensemble Environmental Niche Model (ENMs), (*iii*) a life-history-based distribution model, and (*iv*) fisheries catch data (Table 1). Each source represents a different method of estimating the distribution of a given species and thus, provides a more robust result **than using only one data source**. Only commercial fished species with data from all four sources were included in the analysis.

### *Occurrence data*

Occurrence data was collected **by Reygondeau (2019)** from five publicly available repositories: FishBase (http://fishbase.org), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; https://www.gbif.org/), the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; https://obis.org/), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC; http://ioc-unesco.org), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; https://www.iucn.org/technical-documents/spatial-data) [@Reygondeau:2019uh].

### *Distribution models*

In addition to occurrence data, we used two different methods to estimate species distributions, hereafter referred to as Ecological Niche Model-Nereus (ENM-Nereus) and Species Distribution Model-SAU (SDM-SAU). Although they use the same occurrence and environmental data, the models are structurally different complementing each other and providing robustness to the results.

The ENM-Nereus consists of a multimodel approach based on a Bioclim and a Boosted Regression Tree model [@Thuiller:2009gp], a Maxent model [@Phillips:2006ff], and a Non-Parametric Probabilistic Ecological Niche Model [@Beaugrand:2011fd]. Environmental variables utilized in the models include sea surface temperature, surface pH, surface oxygen concentration, and vertically integrated (0–100 m) net primary production (NPP) [@Asch:2018ca]. Global environmental conditions were average for the **30-year climate normal period of 1970-2000** and averaged for three Earth System Models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL- https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/earth-system-model/), the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL- www.icmc.ipsl.fr/), and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI- www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/). See [@Asch:2018ca; @Reygondeau:2019uh] for model details.

The SDM-SAU model follows a five-steps process based on species-specific life history data, rather than environmental variables [@Close:2006ux; @Pauly:2016uz]. For each commercial marine species, the model first uses the FAO major fishing areas and countries' EEZs to determine a broad distribution. It then uses life history information to delimit its range within the FAO fishing area (e.g., thermal preference, depth limit). The range is delimited even further by expert-review polygons and compared with that of AquaMaps [@Kaschner:2016tl], OBIS and GBIF occurrence data. The model then determines a species habitat preference based on the assumption that the relative abundance of a species is determined by the number of habitats in a grid cell and the distance of the species to each habitat, as well as the importance of the habitat to the species size. Finally, the species equatorial submergence (e.g. the latitudinal region where a species is not seen in between poles) is estimated for each species. See [@Close:2006ux; @Pauly:2016uz] for model details.

### *Catch data*

The previous models combine observational data with a series of biotic and abiotic data to determine the probability that a species will be found in a given space at a given time. However, this does not mean that the species in question will actually be there. While the models do use approaches to double-check species occurrences (e.g., ENM-Nereus uses four different species distribution algorithms and SPD-SAU undertakes validation by means of other models), we used a fourth data source to corroborate the models’ outputs. The *Sea Around Us* estimates total reconstructed catches - catches based on all publicly available information sources and including discards, as well as unreported and illegal catches that are not included in available FAO data - for each country. Catches are also spatially allocated on a $0.5^{\circ}$ x $0.5^{\circ}$ latitude longitude grid [@Zeller2016]. **Roughly, the Sea Around Us method takes each country's officially reported catch data (e.g. National, FAO or RFMO). Secondly, it uses literature (e.g. peer review, grey literature) to identify missing components (e.g. species, gears) and sources of alternative information for missing components. It then derives country estimates for missing data and creates time series interpolation. Finally, the estimated and official data are aggregated for a total reconstructed catch data (See [@Pauly:2019bf] and [@Zeller2016] for catch reconstruction and spatial allocation details.)** We used the *Sea Around Us* catch reconstruction database from 2005 to 2014 as the fourth dataset to estimate transboundary species and to estimate their catch contribution within EEZs. We selected this time frame to investigate the recent (our time frame includes the **last decade of available data**) contribution of transboundary fisheries to catches and revenue from fisheries and to reduce the uncertainty embedded in the reconstruction process (See key uncertainties, below). Note that in call cases we report the average catch from 2005 to 2014.

## Determining transboundary species trait

We developed a **three**-criteria methodology to determine whether or not a species can be considered transboundary. Only species that meet all criteria at least once were considered as “transboundary”, while species that did not meet the criteria for any EEZ analyzed were considered as “discrete”. Note that in some cases a species could meet all criteria for some EEZs, but not for other EEZs, these species were still considered as “transboundary”.

### Criteria 1; Neighboring EEZs

As previously mentioned, we define transboundary species as those marine species that occur within the EEZs of two or more neighboring countries. Hence, according to this criteria a species was only considered as transboundary if it was shared between two neighboring countries, regardless of the species extended distribution. The analysis was undertaken only within the boundaries of the EEZs of coastal states using the Sea Around Us shapefile (updated 1 July 2015, available from http://www.seaaroundus.org), **noting that it subdivides the EEZs of 198 coastal states into 280 regions (e.g., Mexico's EEZ is divided in Mexico Pacific and Mexico Atlantic) including islands territories**, and determined the intersections between polygons using the R package *sf* [@PackagesfSimpleF:2018vp]. When estimating transboundary species, we filtered out those shared by EEZs sub-regions (e.g. USA Gulf of Mexico and USA Atlantic), and when aggregating results by country, species that occurred in more than one sub-region were only accounted for once. Species that were present in EEZs that were non-continental territories neighboring other countries were kept separately (e.g., Argentina and Falkland Islands), but removed in cases where the non-continental territory belonged to the same nation (e.g., Brazil and Fernando de Noronha). Associated states like Puerto Rico and Hong Kong were added to their Sovereign (e.g. Puerto Rico with the United States and Hong Kong with China). 

### Criteria 2; Data agreement

**We used the occurrence database, the ENM-Nereus model, and SDM-SAU model to determine the presence of each species within each of the $0.5^{\circ}$ x $0.5^{\circ}$ grid cells. All analyses only considered cases where all databases matched to obtain a more conservative estimate of transboundary species. Moreover, we assumed that a species was only present in a given grid-cell if it was reported in the Sea *Around Us catch* database. Therefore, all species that were not reported as caught in any single year between the reference years (2005 to 2014) in a given grid-cell were dropped. This rule assumes that if a commercial species is projected within any fishing country, such a species would have been fished, and thus reported at some point over the last decade of data (2005 - 2014), thus validating the models and only selected "current" shared species. We acknowledge that this criteria might limit the global distribution of species thus resulting in a conservative estimate of transboundary species.**

### Criteria 3; Spatial distribution

Finally, to have a more robust result and not categorize a species as transboundary based on its presence in a single $0.5^{\circ}$ x $0.5^{\circ}$ grid cell within an EEZ, we computed an *Area Index*. The *Area Index* consist in the proportion of a given species' overarching shared distribution between neighboring EEZs accounted for by each individual EEZ. We classified a species as transboundary if both neighboring EEZs enclosed over 25% of the species joint shared distribution. **While a species that has less than the selected threshold is not considered transboundary in this paper**, this threshold can be lowered for a more relaxed result or increased for a more conservative estimate (Supplementary Fig. S2).

## Fisheries trends

We estimated the economic contribution in **2019** real USD of transboundary species for each country using global ex-vessel price data [@Tai2017]. The database we draw from includes ex-vessel price derived from multiple sources and a structured interpolation method (e.g. similar countries, species) to fill in data gaps [@Sumaila:2015uc]. **The dataset is harmonized with the SAU catch data to estimate yearly fishing revenue (as ex-vessel price) for all species and EEZs of this study (http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/feru). We report the average fishing revenue of 2005 to 2014 derived from the fishing activity within the global EEZs. We did not include revenue from areas beyond national jurisdiction. We used the monthly average US Consumer Price Index (CPI) according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) to standardize the original 2010 real USD value to 2019 real USD.**

We used the catch data to determine the **catch trend** of each species within an EEZ. Although this method has previously been used to estimate stock status [@Grainger:1996tk], the categories presented here are intended as catch trends, and not fishing status for each species as many environmental and social-economic factors (e.g. temperature, markets, fishing policies, **and fishing effort) affects catches** [@Pauly:2013gs; @Branch:2008kk]. We only assessed species within each EEZ for which at least ten years of data were available between 1951 and 2014 and with at least five consecutive years of data. Three final categories were drawn for each species depending on the catch volume within each EEZ (e.g. present, maximum and minimum EEZ's historical catch) and the year (e.g. year of maximum historical catch of the species within that EEZ) (Table 2) [@Kleisner:2011wn]. Following this concept, Category A would represent fisheries that are **increasing in catch, Category B would be species that have a constant catch rate, and Category C would be species that have seen a decrease in catch in the last 10 years. Finally, we reported the predominant category over the time period considered.**

## Statistical analysis

All analyses were run using the statistical software *R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20)* with the packages *data.table* [@Packagedatatable:2019uh], *janitor* [@PackagejanitorSim:2018ur], *wesanderson* [@Packagewesanderson:2018vn], *rfishbase* [@PackagerfishbaseR:2019th], *R.matlab* [@PackageRmatlabRe:2018un], *sf* [@PackagesfSimpleF:2018vp], *sp* [@PackagespClasses:2019tn], *tidiverse* [@PackagetidyverseE:2017vq], *tidytext* [@PackagetidytextTe:2019vk], and *zoo* [@PackagezooSInfr:2019tm]. All code is available at https://github.com/jepa/FishForVisa. All maps were made with Natural Earth data available at https://www.naturalearthdata.com/. We performed a series of one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to determine statistically significant differences between the means of different groups (e.g., geographical regions, species, catch trends) of transboundary species and their contribution to catch and fishing revenue [@Chambers:1992up; @Krzanowski:1990wm]. We used the standard *R* functions for the ANOVA and MANOVA after testing for assumptions. In cases where the ANOVA assumptions were not clearly met we ran the non-parametric version Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test to confirm the results [@Hollander:2013wz]. 


## Key uncertainties
<!-- # Related to Criteria 1 (neighbors) -->
We have identified four key uncertainties in the method that may affect the estimation of transboundary species Firstly, we ran the analysis at the species level due to limited spatial-specific data on species sub populations (stocks), therefore we are not able to identify transboundary stocks within EEZs. While we acknowledge that a species could have multiple stocks within an EEZ, many fisheries within a country or EEZ are managed at the species instead of stock level. Also, recent research has suggested strong connectivity between stocks, even when separated by thousands of kilometers [@Ramesh:2019va] providing additional ecological ground for our analysis. We limited the distribution of a species by defining transboundary only between neighboring countries (e.g. US and Canada) and did not include countries that were separated by another country (e.g. Canada and Mexico) and/or the high seas (e.g. Canada and Spain). Our results are likely a conservative estimation of transboundary species as we did not cover all marine taxa in the world [@Reygondeau:2019uh] and only analyzed species present in all four data sources. Nevertheless, our results are representative of a substantial proportion of the world's marine catches and revenue from economically important marine fisheries.
<!-- Related to Criteria 2 (Models) -->
Secondly, the predicted species distribution is affected by the uncertainties of the environmental data and models used for such predictions. Structural differences within Earth System Models results in variations of oceanic conditions, which undoubtedly affect the ENM-Nereus. We averaged the results from the three models in an effort to capture the structural variation across models. Climate natural variability is a major driver of marine species distribution, potentially removing a species from an EEZ for long periods (e.g. Anchovies and Sardines "regimes" in the Eastern Pacific are strongly influenced by water temperature decal oscillations [@Chavez:2003jr]). Thus, a species’ distribution can potentially be reduced or shifted in such a way that it only covers one EEZ until oceanic conditions change again and the associated species' distribution expands. To account for such climate variability, we derived the ENM-Nereus results as an average of oceanic conditions between 1970 and 2000. This is not an issue for the SDM-SAU as it does not directly require environmental variables [@Pauly:2016uz].
<!-- Related to Criteria 3 (SAU catch data) -->
Thirdly, we assumed that, if the Sea Around Us reconstructed data recorded a species as caught in any given grid cell, then the species was present within that grid cell. While catch data are not exempt of uncertainty, in most cases, the differences between the Sea Around Us and the FAO self-reported data are smaller towards recent years [@Pauly:2019bf]. Thus, we limited the catch data reference period in our analyses to between 2005 and 2014, the last ten years of data available. Likewise, the spatial allocation of the catch is subjected to impressions, mainly produced by differences in the spatial scale of the original data and the method employed by the Sea Around Us. 
<!-- Related to Criteria 4; Spatial distribution -->
Finally, the results of this study only considered those species that all datasets agree on presence and at least 25% of *Area Index* (e.g. the species shared distribution was at least 25% in each EEZ). This presents a relative conservative estimate of the number of transboundary species in the world. However, using a different *Species Index* will give results based on less datasets while a smaller *Area Index* will estimate more transboundary species (Supplementary Fig. S2).

<!-- From 1973 to 1982, members of the United Nations held a series of meetings to discuss regulations regarding the high seas, a region of international common property, at that time, consisting of waters from 12 miles from shore [@McRaeandMunro1989]. The establishment of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allowed coastal states to claim jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources over 200 nautical miles off their coasts [@UN:1982]. While intended to improve fisheries management by granting property rights over shared resources, this arbitrary delimitation of management areas was not informed by bio-geography, essentially ignoring species distributions and creating what we know today as shared fish stocks [@Gulland, @Munro2002]. Fish stocks, are comonly refered in fisheries management as a particular population that is more or less isolated from other stocks of the same species and hence self-sustaining [@FAO:1999tk]. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recognizes three types of shared stocks: (*i*) transboundary stocks, shared by 2 or more neighboring coastal nations; (*ii*) straddling stocks, occurring in two or more adjacent national jurisdictions and the high seas; and (*iii*) highly migratory stocks, found in the EEZs of coastal nations that are not necessarily adjoining, and the high seas. The inception of shared stocks called for the establishment of new fisheries management methods. Managers and scientists adopted a game theory approach – or means to analyze strategic interactions among decision-makers – which demonstrates that collaboration is most likely to result in the best overall outcome for nations sharing a common resource [@Bailey:2010ga,@Eide:2013dh]. Lack of collaboration in shared stocks may threaten stock sustainability [@Clark:1980js; @Nguyen:2018dk], reduce the profitability potential of the fishery [@Merino:2007jz], and lead to conflict between coastal nations [@Spijkers:2017ij], although cooperation and non-cooperation can be more complex [@Jensen:2015cf]. Moreover, under climate change, species distributions will shift [@Cheung2016], resulting in new shared stocks [@Pinsky:2018cb] and highlighting the key role cooperative fisheries management can play in maintaining stocks and profitability [@Nguyen:2018dk] as well as hopefully reducing fisheries conflict [@Spijkers:2019cz]. -->

<!-- There is a gap in assessing the nature and number of transboundary species in the world based on their spatial distribution. Caddy [@Caddy:1997ue] in 1997 estimated that there could be up to 1,500 transboundary fish species in the world. However, such estimation lacked a proper assessment due to limited information on the distribution of species at the time [@Caddy:1997ue]. More recently, Teh et al. [@Teh:2015gd] estimated that 206 species can be considered shared, accounting for a total catch of 34.2 million t and a global landed value of USD 30.7 trillion. While this represents a good starting point, the analysis was based on a literature review of shared species and did not include a mechanistic way of determining the transboundary nature of the species [@Teh:2015gd]. Thus, despite recent research highlighting the interconnection of marine species [@Ramesh:2019va], the total number of transboundary species is yet to be identified at a global scale. Yet, such an understanding is critical to effectively managing fisheries, as needs differ substantially between discreet and shared species [@Mills] and climate change will yield new challenges associated with new shared fisheries [@Pinsky:2018cb]. -->

<!-- *Getting accurate estimates of the number of shared species and where they are located can help develop fisheries management and conservation plans that account for the challenges from transboundary resources management.*  -->

<!-- The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recognizes three types of shared stocks: (i) transboundary stocks, shared by 2 or more neighboring coastal nations; (ii) straddling stocks, occurring in two or more adjacent national jurisdictions and the high seas; and (iii) highly migratory stocks, found in the EEZs of coastal nations that are not necessarily adjoining, and the high seas. We focus on estimating the number of species that meet the first category. -->

<!-- We used four-criteria that combined multiple species distribution data-sources and the world's EEZs to determine if a species can be considered a “shared species”. The first criteria consisted in only considering shared species between neighboring EEZs, rather than the extended distribution. For the second criteria we considered a species to be present in a grid cell if all data sources predicted positive occurrence. Current species distributions were predicted from occurrence records obtained from publicly available observational databases of the world’s marine species and two structurally distinct species distribution models [@Asch:2018ca; Reygondeau:2019uh; @Zeller2016] (see Methods). The third criteria determined whether the species were exploited at the grid cell using spatially explicit catch data [@Zeller2016]. A species was kept if both catch data and predicted species occurrences were positive at the same spatial cells. Finally, the last criteria determined a spatial threshold to confirm that a species occurs in both neighboring EEZs. Once we have identified the shared stocks, we estimated the contribution of the species to fishing revenues and landings using the SAU database [@Zeller2016] and categorized them according to catch trends [@Kleisner:2013gh].  -->

<!-- We found significant differences in catch trends based on whether or not a species was transboundary (MANOVA, *Df*(2,459) = 19.001, *p* < 0.001).**Transboundary species that are only fished by one country are generally less likely to have a decreasing catch trend compared to when the species is shared by neighboring countries (Supplementary Table S2)**. While no significant differences were found for all categories within transboundary species (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(2,459) = 47.94, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05; Tukey's post hoc test *p* $\leq$ 0.001), significant differences in catch trends for the 305 discrete species (one-way ANOVA, *Df*(2,106) = 1.885, *p* = 0.157; $\alpha$p = 0.05). -->
