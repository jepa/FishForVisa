The number of grid cells in which a species is present (Area Index) is expected to directly influence whether or not a species is considered transboundary. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity of our results to the Area Index by estimating the number of transboundary species along a gradient of values (Figure \@ref(fig:ffvFigureS3)). As expected, using a more relaxed value (e.g. the species is present within 10% or more of the EEZ) will result in a greater number of transboundary species (median of 40 EEZs shared per species), while a more restrictive value (e.g., 50%) results in a median estimate of 4. The current analysis utilized a 25% Area Index threshold (Figure \@ref(fig:ffvFigureS3)) - darker histogram).

```{r ffvFigureS3, eval = T, fig.width=6, fig.height=9, echo=FALSE, fig.pos= "H", fig.cap="Histogram of number of transboundary species using different Area Index threshold values. The darker histogram represents the threshold (25%) used in the present analysis. Figure created using R version 3.5.2."}
