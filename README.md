# Project Goal:

- Determine the number of current fisheries that are shared by neighboring countries (transboundary)
- Estimate their contribution to global fishing catch and revenue

## Files and folders organization:

In this repository you will find all of the code related to the manuscript *Marine species do not need visas: the transboundary nature of the world’s exploited marine species*. 

### Folders

- `Figures`: Manuscript final figures

- `Manuscript_Instructions`: Submission instructions from the journal

- `References`: Documents needed for the references of the manuscript including the reference list

- `Scripts`: Contains the files used to run the analysis and write the manuscript

### Data

The raw data used in this analysis comes from different sources including *OBIS*, *GBIF*, *The Sea Around Us*, and *FishBase*, among others. These can be sourced directly from their respectively webpages and/or the references provided on the text. The data containing the identification of transboundary species per eez and fishing nation (e.g. the main result of this work) and the catch trend of each taxon per eez can be found in the `Data` folder.
